# Python with Docker
This is the easiest langauge (for me) to create dockerfiles for. Possibly since I have used docker with Python the most or for whatever reason it's easier for me to follow. 

## Build Docker Image
* $ docker build -t py .
* $ docker image ls
* You should be able to see your new py image

## Run Docker Image
* $ docker run py
